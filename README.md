## prox_config_backup

I just wrote this script quick and dirty.
Some people use it on a daily basis (including me).

There might be a PBS backup feature to backup PVE cluster config in the near future provided by the Proxmox team.
But since this was only mentioned on the roadmap we still have to wait.

Meanwhile I manage all PVE nodes with Ansible and usually have no need to restore configuration unless all cluster
nodes failed at once. But having a full cluster config backup is still useful and makes PVE admins sleep well at night (or day).

### Backup
* Download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerDanilo/proxmox-stuff/master/prox_config_backup.sh)  
```cd /root/; wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerDanilo/proxmox-stuff/master/prox_config_backup.sh```
* Set the permanent backups directory environment variable ```export BACK_DIR="/path/to/backup/directory"```
* Make the script executable ```chmod +x ./prox_config_backup.sh```
* Shut down ALL VMs + LXC Containers if you want to go the save way. (Not required)
* Run the script ```./prox_config_backup.sh```

### Using the script in a cronjob
* To use the script non-interactively, add the ```-a``` switch.

### Restore
On my machine, you end up with a GZipped file of about 1-5 MB with a name like "proxmox_backup_proxmoxhostname_2017-12-02.15.48.10.tar.gz".  
Depending upon how you schedule it and the size of your server, that could eventually become a space issue so don't  
forget to set up some kind of archive maintenance.

To restore, move the file back to proxmox with cp, scp, webmin, a thumb drive, whatever.  
I place it back into the /var/tmp directory from where it came. 

```
# Unpack the original backup
tar -zxvf proxmox_backup_proxmoxhostname_2017-12-02.15.48.10.tar.gz
# unpack the tared contents
tar -xvf proxmoxpve.2017-12-02.15.48.10.tar
tar -xvf proxmoxetc.2017-12-02.15.48.10.tar
tar -xvf proxmoxroot.2017-12-02.15.48.10.tar

# If the services are running, stop them:
for i in pve-cluster pvedaemon vz qemu-server; do systemctl stop $i ; done

# Copy the old content to the original directory:
cp -avr /var/tmp/var/tmp/etc /etc
cp -avr /var/tmp/var/tmp/var /var
cp -avr /var/tmp/var/tmp/root /root

# And, finally, restart services:
for i in qemu-server vz pvedaemon pve-cluster; do systemctl start $i ; done
```

If nothing goes wrong, and you have separately restored the VM images using the default Proxmox process.  
You should be back where you started. But let's hope it never comes to that.
